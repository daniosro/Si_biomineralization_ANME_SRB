## Layout

The repository is split into two main directories. Within each directory is a `README.md` file which summarizes the purpose of that directory . The two main directories are:

### **`PNAS`**
This directory includes the data files and code for the Osorio-Rodriguez et al. (2023) paper in review at PNAS.

* **`data`** 
All raw data collected from the experiments and analytical measurements in this work. 

* **`code`** 
Files with the code for the modelling performed in this work. 

### **`Geology`**
This directory includes the data files and code for the Osorio-Rodriguez et al. paper in preparation for Geology.

* **`data`** 
All raw data collected from the experiments and analytical measurements in this work. 

* **`code`** 
Files with the code for the modelling performed in this work.

### Other Files
There are some files which I consider to be mandatory for any project.

1. **`LICENSE`**:
