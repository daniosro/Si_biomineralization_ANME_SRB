## Layout

The repository is split into two main directories:

### **`PNAS`**
This directory includes the data files and code for the following paper:
Osorio-Rodriguez, D., Metcalfe, K. S., McGlynn, S. E., Yu, H., Dekas, A. E., Ellisman, M., ... & Orphan, V. J. (2023). Microbially induced precipitation of silica by anaerobic methane-oxidizing consortia and implications for microbial fossil preservation. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 120(51), e2302156120.

* **`data`** 
All raw data collected from the experiments and analytical measurements in this work:

1.  Dataset S1. Elemental composition of Si-rich rings surrounding ANME2-SRB aggregates. The different spectra correspond to the points shown in Figs. 4 and 5.

2. Dataset S2. Supplementary Excel data file with Al:Si ratios for different basins and treatments, utilized to make the plots in Fig. 3.

3. Dataset S3. Supplementary Excel data file with (Mg+Al+Fe):Si ratios for different basins and treatments, utilized to make the plots in Fig. 3.

4. Dataset S4. Supplementary Excel data file with the concentrations of relevant elements in sediment-free ANME-SRB incubations, setup with consortia isolated from the Santa Monica basin seep sediments.

* **`code`** 
Files with the code for the modelling performed in this work:

1. ANOVA_compositions: Statistical comparisons of Al:Si and (Mg+Al+Fe):Si between treatments of silicates from sediments, Si-rich phase attached to ANME-SRB consortia isolated from sediments in incubations, and Si-rich phase attached to ANME-SRB consortia in sediments.

2. AOM_consortia_growth_model: Model for the growth of AOM consortia, described in the results section.

### **`Geology`**
This directory includes the data files and code for the Osorio-Rodriguez et al. paper in preparation for Geology.

* **`data`** 
All raw data collected from the analytical measurements in this work:

1. c_results: Secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) data for the C siotope compositions of modern ANME-SRB aggregates in situ and extracted from seep carbonates, confirmed with FISH, and purported aggregates in ancient methane seep carbonates.

2. EDS_spectra_1: Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data for confirmed and purported ANME-SRB aggregates.

3. raman_all: Raman data for confirmed and purported ANME-SRB aggregates, as well as black carbon produced by ANME, from Allen et al. (2021).

4. TB_isotopes: C and O isotope compositions of modern and ancient methane seep carbonates, from this and previous works.

* **`templates`** 
Notebooks with the code to visualize the data:

1. Carbonate_isotopes: C and O isotope compositions of modern and ancient methane seep carbonates, from this and previous works.

2. EDS_template: Visualization of EDS data (Figure 5).

3. Raman_template: Visualization of Raman data (Figure 7).

4. SIMS_template: Visualization of Secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) data, used to make Figure 8.
