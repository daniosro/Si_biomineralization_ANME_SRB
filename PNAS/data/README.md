## `data`
This directory houses all small (< 100 MB) datasets that are a result of individual experiments and/or measurements. 

Dataset S1. Elemental composition of Si-rich rings surrounding ANME2-SRB aggregates. The different spectra correspond to the points shown in Figs. 4 and 5. 

Dataset S2. Supplementary Excel data file with Al:Si ratios for different basins and treatments, utilized to make the plots in Fig. 3.

Dataset S3. Supplementary Excel data file with (Mg+A+Fe)l:Si ratios for different basins and treatments, utilized to make the plots in Fig. 3.

Dataset S4. Supplementary Excel data file with the concentrations of relevant elements in sediment-free ANME-SRB incubations, setup with consortia isolated from the Santa mONICA basin seep sediments.
